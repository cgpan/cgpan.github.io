<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Measurement, Evaluation, and Statistics program at Teachers College, Columbia University, where I am advised by Professor [Youmi Suk](https://youmisuk.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of **causal machine learning**, **dynamic treatment regimes (DTR)**, and **generative AI for synthetic tabular data**.

Before pursuing my PhD, I spent nearly a decade at New Oriental Education & Technology Group in Beijing, where I held roles including business manager, instructor, and researcher for the graduate examination department.
